# Task 6 Completion Summary: Update utility functions for ElevenLabs compatibility

## Task Requirements Met

✅ **Modify get_next_output_filename to work with ElevenLabs audio format**
- The function already works with both gTTS and ElevenLabs
- Both engines use MP3 format and sequential numbering (0001.mp3, 0002.mp3, etc.)
- Enhanced with better error handling and security features

✅ **Ensure file naming consistency between gTTS and ElevenLabs outputs**
- Both engines use the same utility function `get_next_output_filename`
- Sequential numbering is maintained regardless of which engine generates the files
- Files are saved in the same directory structure: `outputs/{tempdir}/audio/tts/`

✅ **Verify combine_wav functionality works with ElevenLabs generated files**
- The `combine_wav` endpoint uses `validate_audio_files_for_combine` utility function
- This function works with MP3 files from both engines
- Mixed gTTS and ElevenLabs files can be combined seamlessly

## Requirements Addressed

### Requirement 3.1
> WHEN ElevenLabs generates audio files THEN the system SHALL save them in the same directory structure as gTTS files

**Status: ✅ COMPLETED**
- Both engines use `get_next_output_filename` which creates the same directory structure
- Directory pattern: `outputs/{tempdir}/audio/tts/`
- File naming pattern: `0001.mp3, 0002.mp3, 0003.mp3...`

### Requirement 3.2
> WHEN I call the combine_wav endpoint THEN the system SHALL successfully combine audio files regardless of which engine generated them

**Status: ✅ COMPLETED**
- The `combine_wav` endpoint uses `validate_audio_files_for_combine` utility function
- This function discovers and validates MP3 files from both engines
- Audio files are combined in sequential order regardless of source engine

## Utility Functions Enhanced

### 1. `get_next_output_filename(tempdir: str) -> str`
- **Purpose**: Generate sequential filenames for both gTTS and ElevenLabs
- **Format**: `outputs/{tempdir}/audio/tts/{NNNN}.mp3`
- **Features**: 
  - Path sanitization to prevent directory traversal
  - Automatic directory creation
  - Sequential numbering based on existing files

### 2. `validate_audio_files_for_combine(tempdir: str) -> List[str]`
- **Purpose**: Discover and validate audio files for combining
- **Compatibility**: Works with files from both engines
- **Features**:
  - Finds all MP3 files in session directory
  - Returns sorted list for sequential processing
  - Validates directory existence and file availability

### 3. `get_combined_output_path(tempdir: str) -> str`
- **Purpose**: Generate output path for combined WAV file
- **Format**: `outputs/combined_{tempdir}.wav`
- **Features**: Path sanitization and consistent naming

## Testing Completed

### 1. Basic Compatibility Tests (`test_utils_compatibility.py`)
- ✅ File naming consistency across engines
- ✅ Directory structure consistency
- ✅ Sequential file generation
- ✅ File discovery for combining
- ✅ Error handling and security

### 2. ElevenLabs-Specific Tests (`test_elevenlabs_compatibility.py`)
- ✅ ElevenLabs file generation workflow
- ✅ Mixed gTTS and ElevenLabs file compatibility
- ✅ Audio format compatibility
- ✅ Error handling with ElevenLabs workflow

### 3. Integration Tests (`final_test.py`)
- ✅ End-to-end workflow simulation
- ✅ File generation → validation → combining
- ✅ Audio duration verification
- ✅ Cleanup verification

## API Integration Verified

The `tts_api.py` already imports and uses the utility functions correctly:

```python
from utils import get_next_output_filename, validate_audio_files_for_combine, get_combined_output_path
```

### ElevenLabs TTS Endpoint (`/tts_elevenlabs`)
- Uses `get_next_output_filename` for consistent file naming
- Saves MP3 files in the same format as gTTS

### Combine Endpoint (`/combine_wav`)
- Uses `validate_audio_files_for_combine` to discover files
- Uses `get_combined_output_path` for output naming
- Works seamlessly with files from both engines

## Conclusion

Task 6 has been **COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY**. The utility functions are fully compatible with ElevenLabs, maintain file naming consistency between engines, and ensure that the `combine_wav` functionality works with files generated by either gTTS or ElevenLabs.

All requirements (3.1 and 3.2) have been met and thoroughly tested.
