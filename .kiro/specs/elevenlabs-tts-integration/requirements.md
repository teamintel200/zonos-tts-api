# Requirements Document

## Introduction

기존 gTTS 기반 한국어 TTS API는 그대로 유지하면서, ElevenLabs AI TTS 기능을 위한 별도의 API 엔드포인트들을 추가하는 기능입니다. ElevenLabs는 더 자연스럽고 고품질의 음성을 제공하며, 사용자가 자신의 API 키를 제공하여 사용할 수 있습니다.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use ElevenLabs TTS through dedicated endpoints, so that I can access high-quality AI voice synthesis while keeping the existing gTTS functionality intact.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I send a request to ElevenLabs TTS endpoint THEN the system SHALL provide a separate endpoint `/tts_elevenlabs` 
2. WHEN I use the new endpoint THEN the existing `/tts_simple` endpoint SHALL remain unchanged and functional
3. WHEN I call `/tts_elevenlabs` THEN the system SHALL use ElevenLabs API for text-to-speech conversion
4. WHEN I call `/tts_simple` THEN the system SHALL continue using gTTS functionality as before

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to provide my ElevenLabs API key and specify voice options, so that I can use my own account and customize voice characteristics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calling `/tts_elevenlabs` THEN the system SHALL require an "api_key" parameter in the request body
2. WHEN using ElevenLabs endpoint THEN the system SHALL accept an optional "voice_id" parameter
3. IF no voice_id is specified THEN the system SHALL use a default Korean-compatible voice
4. WHEN I provide an invalid api_key THEN the system SHALL return an authentication error message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the ElevenLabs integration to work with the existing workflow, so that I can use the same combine functionality regardless of the TTS engine used.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ElevenLabs generates audio files THEN the system SHALL save them in the same directory structure as gTTS files
2. WHEN I call the combine_wav endpoint THEN the system SHALL successfully combine audio files regardless of which engine generated them
3. WHEN using ElevenLabs THEN the system SHALL return the same response format as gTTS for consistency

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper error handling for ElevenLabs API failures, so that the service remains reliable even when the external API has issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ElevenLabs API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL return a clear error message indicating the service is temporarily unavailable
2. WHEN ElevenLabs API key is invalid or expired THEN the system SHALL return an authentication error
3. WHEN ElevenLabs API rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate rate limit error
4. WHEN ElevenLabs API returns an error THEN the system SHALL log the error details for debugging

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to access available ElevenLabs voices using my API key, so that I can choose the most suitable voice for my application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I request available voices THEN the system SHALL provide a new endpoint `/voices/elevenlabs` that accepts my API key
2. WHEN I call the voices endpoint with valid API key THEN the system SHALL return voice information including voice_id, name, category, and language support
3. WHEN I provide an invalid API key THEN the system SHALL return an authentication error
4. WHEN ElevenLabs API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate service unavailable error

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to customize essential ElevenLabs voice settings, so that I can control voice quality for Korean text-to-speech.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using ElevenLabs engine THEN the system SHALL accept optional "stability" parameter (0.0-1.0) to control voice consistency
2. WHEN using ElevenLabs engine THEN the system SHALL accept optional "similarity_boost" parameter (0.0-1.0) to enhance voice similarity
3. WHEN voice settings are not provided THEN the system SHALL use default values: stability=0.5, similarity_boost=0.8
4. WHEN invalid voice settings are provided THEN the system SHALL return a validation error with acceptable ranges

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to preview voice samples using my API key, so that I can test different voices before using them in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I request a voice sample THEN the system SHALL provide a new endpoint `/voices/elevenlabs/{voice_id}/sample` that accepts my API key
2. WHEN I call the sample endpoint with valid API key THEN the system SHALL return a short audio sample of the specified voice
3. WHEN the voice_id is invalid THEN the system SHALL return a 404 error with appropriate message
4. WHEN I provide an invalid API key THEN the system SHALL return an authentication error
