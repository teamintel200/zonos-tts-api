# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature integrates Clerk authentication system with the existing TTS API service to provide user authentication, session management, usage tracking, and subscription-based access control. The system will enable Google OAuth login, track individual user API usage, manage user-specific temporary files, and support tiered subscription services.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to log in with my Google account through Clerk, so that I can securely access the TTS service with personalized features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the application THEN the system SHALL display a login interface powered by Clerk
2. WHEN a user clicks "Sign in with Google" THEN the system SHALL redirect to Google OAuth authentication
3. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL create or retrieve the user session
4. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL display their profile information and available features
5. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL terminate the session and redirect to the login page

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to track each user's TTS API usage, so that I can monitor service consumption and enforce usage limits.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authenticated user makes a TTS API request THEN the system SHALL log the request with user ID, timestamp, and resource consumption
2. WHEN tracking usage THEN the system SHALL record text length, voice model used, and generated audio duration
3. WHEN a user exceeds their usage limit THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error message and deny the request
4. WHEN an administrator queries usage data THEN the system SHALL provide detailed analytics per user and time period
5. IF a user is not authenticated THEN the system SHALL reject the TTS request with an authentication error

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want my generated audio files to be stored securely and temporarily, so that I can access my recent conversions while maintaining privacy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user generates TTS audio THEN the system SHALL create a user-specific directory using their unique user ID
2. WHEN storing audio files THEN the system SHALL use a secure naming convention that prevents unauthorized access
3. WHEN a user requests their files THEN the system SHALL only return files associated with their authenticated session
4. WHEN files are older than the retention period THEN the system SHALL automatically delete them
5. IF an unauthenticated user attempts to access files THEN the system SHALL deny access with an authentication error

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want to implement subscription tiers with different usage limits, so that I can monetize the service and provide value-based pricing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user signs up THEN the system SHALL assign them to a free tier with basic usage limits
2. WHEN a user upgrades their subscription THEN the system SHALL update their usage limits and available features
3. WHEN checking subscription status THEN the system SHALL integrate with Stripe or similar payment processor
4. WHEN a subscription expires THEN the system SHALL downgrade the user to the free tier
5. WHEN a user reaches their tier limit THEN the system SHALL offer upgrade options before denying service
6. IF payment fails THEN the system SHALL notify the user and provide grace period before service restriction

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see my current usage and subscription status, so that I can manage my account and understand my service limits.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses their dashboard THEN the system SHALL display current usage statistics and remaining quota
2. WHEN displaying subscription info THEN the system SHALL show current plan, billing cycle, and next payment date
3. WHEN a user approaches their usage limit THEN the system SHALL display warnings and upgrade suggestions
4. WHEN subscription status changes THEN the system SHALL update the dashboard in real-time
5. WHEN a user wants to manage billing THEN the system SHALL provide secure links to payment management

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the authentication system to integrate seamlessly with the existing TTS API, so that current functionality is preserved while adding security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating Clerk THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing API endpoints
2. WHEN authentication is added THEN the system SHALL use middleware to verify user sessions without breaking existing flows
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages distinguishing between authentication and TTS service issues
4. WHEN the system starts THEN the system SHALL initialize Clerk configuration and verify connectivity
5. IF Clerk service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL handle graceful degradation or maintenance mode
